# DBMS_PROJECT

This project is based on an E-commerce website for Bidirectional Interaction that is selling and buying the products and also provides multisuer support with concurrency.

The Database used is Sqlite which is the inbulit DB in Django and all the aspects of DBMS are taken care of i.e(Normalisation,Transaction,ER-Relation Mapping).

Caution for using the libraries

1)It is better to use in an UNIX environment as some libraries are supported by UNIX OS.

2)The items in each file are large so they are compressed we have to extract the files in the same directory as shown.

3)Since DJango works on the directory hierarchy system so the ordering of directories important.

4)The SQL queries can be performed Normally.

5)There are several multiple pages of code(HTML,CSS,Bootstrap) and there are many files(media,images,document) which has to be placed in order.
